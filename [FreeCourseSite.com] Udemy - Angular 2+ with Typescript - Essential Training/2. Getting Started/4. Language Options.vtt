Angular 2 provides a variety of options when
choosing a language to code in.

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:14.789
We can use ES5 which is the current version
of javascript, Dart, CoffeeScript, either

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:21.230
of the newer versions of javascript known
as ES2015 as well as a future version of javascript

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:26.890
known as ES7 or Typescript, which really is
the preferred language.

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:33.570
No matter what language you choosing, everything
gets transpiled or turned into browser readable

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.090
ES5 Javascript.

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.930
To see some examples of the different language
options and how they’re used in angular

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:45.300
2, lets navigate over to the angular.io.

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.250
By clicking Get Started we are presented with
the reference docs.

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:56.240
On every page we see a clickable option for
for displaying one of 3 different code selections.

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:01.940
So we can choose Typescript, ES5 Javascript
or Dart.

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:07.970
Angular 2 is itself is written in typescript
and most of the examples, courses and tutorials

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.070
you’ll see on the web are also written in
typescript.

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:17.620
Google selected the use of typescript when
writing Angular 2 because of the awesome language

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:20.970
enhancements typescript provides.

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:26.690
Lets now take a moment to introduce the typescript
language and understand the benefits of using

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:27.350
typescript.
