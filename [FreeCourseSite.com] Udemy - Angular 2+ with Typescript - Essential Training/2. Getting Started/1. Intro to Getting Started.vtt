Hello and welcome to the getting started section
of this course.

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:08.059
In this section you will learn what is Angular
JS is.

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:13.410
Then we’ll discuss why the decision was
made for a version 2 of Angular which led

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.280
to a complete re-write of the code base.

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:21.880
Then we’ll discuss the different coding
options we have to write our Angular 2 code.

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.929
This will lead us into a discussion of Typescript.

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:30.599
And we’ll highlight why typescript was such
a fantastic language choice for coding Angular

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:31.869
2 applications.
