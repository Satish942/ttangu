00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:03.420
Now we’re back here in our app.

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:09.790
And we’re going to be using the Book interface
in this example, so lets open up book.ts and

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:11.690
make a few changes.

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:15.620
These properties right here reflect our API,
for this example

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:19.390
I want to use properties that match what’s
currently being displayed.

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:22.050
So I’ll comment this out for now.

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:28.930
And then add in these new properties for use
in our service.

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:32.770
Now I’m now going to add a new file called
book.service.ts.

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:41.690
I’ll start by exporting a class of BookService.

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.519
Now I need to add in my imports.

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:48.859
First will be Injectable from angular core.

00:00:48.859 --> 00:00:53.789
Then Http from angular dash http.

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.409
And also import my Book Interface.

00:00:57.409 --> 00:01:02.850
Above my class definition I need to add my
Injectable decorator.

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:09.210
Then inside of my class I’m going to create
a method called getBooks which is of type

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.700
IBook for our interface.

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.620
Then I’m going to return an array of books.

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:22.820
And this array is going to the same array
that we hardcoded into our books-list component

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:23.820
file.

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:30.970
So I’ll just copy from there and paste it
into our service.

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:37.020
We need to make sure we register our serivce
as a provider in our app.module file.

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:44.140
So we’ll go into that file, import our BookService
from its location.

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:51.590
Then add key of providers to our NgModule
that defines an array and currently just holds

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:53.420
our bookService.

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.710
Now we’re ready to use our service inside
our component.

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:08.600
Going back into our books-list component file
I’ll start off my importing our service.

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:13.840
Then I’m going to add a new property of
books which is an array of type Ibook.

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.579
So here we’ll be using the books as what
was being used down below.

00:02:16.579 --> 00:02:21.060
Below that I’ll add my constructor.

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:28.030
Inside the parenthesis I need to add a private
variable of underscore bookService is of type

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.900
BookService which we just imported.

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:37.790
The convention whenever injecting services
inside the constructor is to prefix the variable

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.530
declaration with an underscore.

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:45.060
Then inside of the curly brackets is where
I’m going to set my books property equal

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:50.810
to my bookService dot getBooks method.

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:55.790
This is going to do the same thing as this
code right here, so we’ll just comment it

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:57.280
out for now.

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:02.760
In future demonstrations we’re going to
be using ngOnInit here as opposed to loading

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.200
our data inside the constructor.

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:10.069
This example is mainly is just to get you
familiar with the constructor and how services

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:11.129
work.

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:16.650
So we’ll save all that, load up our app
and you can see its working same as before

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.519
with no errors, cool.
