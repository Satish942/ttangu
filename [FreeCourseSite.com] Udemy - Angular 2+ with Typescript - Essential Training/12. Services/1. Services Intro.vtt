00:00:00.909 --> 00:00:02.920
Hello and welcome back.

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:05.549
In this section we’ll be discussing Services.

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.870
We’ll start off with a definition of what
services are and how they can be used in our

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:11.910
application.

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.160
This will include the Building of a Service,
Registering the service as a Provider, and

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.220
Injecting the service inside a component.

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:26.590
We’ll also revisit the concept of Dependency
Injection and how angular injects a single

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:29.939
instance or Singleton whenever a service is
used.

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.300
We’ll also take our first look at the constructor.

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.550
The constructor being a method that is used
in a class to perform any initial setup.
