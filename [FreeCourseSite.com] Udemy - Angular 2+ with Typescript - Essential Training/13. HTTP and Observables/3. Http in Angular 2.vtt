00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:06.049
We use http in order to send requests for
data.

00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:10.700
A few requests we can make are GET requests
in order to fetch some data.

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:14.870
And PUT requests that are used to add or alter
some piece of data.

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:19.660
Angular makes it very easy for us to work
with these http requests.

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:28.230
All we need to do is import Http from angular/http,
then add the HttpModule inside our NgModule

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.579
file and add it to our list of imports.

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:36.240
We need to create an instance of Http so it
can be used in our class.

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:41.750
We do this inside the constructor by adding
a private variable of http.

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:43.360
Then we can start making requests.

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:50.290
In this case itâ€™s a get request made to
a books.json file located in our api folder.

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:54.720
Then we need to map our response before sending
it to the component.

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.530
Lets now add an Http GET request to our application.
