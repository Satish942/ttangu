00:00:01.189 --> 00:00:04.820
Hello and welcome back to Angular 2 essential
training.

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:09.440
In this section we’ll be discussing HTTP
and observables.

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:15.999
HTTP is what we use whenever we want to retreive
something from our database or an API.

00:00:15.999 --> 00:00:20.280
Not a lot has changed between angular 1 and
angular 2 in this regard.

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:25.910
We’re still using the keyword http in order
to perform our requests.

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:29.180
What has changed is how we handle the response.

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:34.030
Angular 2 has made the switch to using RxJS
observables.

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:39.999
Observables essentially emit responses over
time, instead of the response being a one

00:00:39.999 --> 00:00:41.929
time occurance.

00:00:41.929 --> 00:00:48.309
So we’ll first discuss what an Observable
is and how it differs from a typical promise-based

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:49.309
response.

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:52.920
Then we’ll discuss how to perform Http requests.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:59.839
This will include performing an http GET request
to retrieve our data, processing the response

00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:05.290
object as an Observable and then subscribing
to the Observable in our component.

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:11.350
We’ll be using our ngOnInit lifecycle hook
in order to display our data.
