00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:04.890
Components, as we’ve learned, are at the
heart of Angular.

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:10.150
When composing our application our components
form a tree-like structure in which these

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:12.640
components become nested.

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:18.920
These nested or Child components need a way
of receiving data from its parent as well

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:21.970
as sending data back to its parent.

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:27.510
In order to accomplish this Angular provides
us with Inputs and Outputs.

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.099
Lets first focus on Inputs.

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:39.020
Input is a decorator used inside a child component
that allows data to flow from a parent component

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.190
into the child component.

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:48.250
Whenever a nested component wants to receive
input from its container, it must expose a

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:52.190
property next to an Input decorator.

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:57.989
And this exposed property then gets binded
to a value in the parent.

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:04.570
So inside of our child component we first
need to import the Input decorator.

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:09.060
And then inside our class we invoke our Input
here.

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.410
And then we create a property of whatever
we want, in this case named reviews.

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:19.049
This property name can be anything, and you
can think of it like a variable that’s going

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:24.040
to represent some value we get from the parent.

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.170
And then we need to define its type, which
in this case is a number.

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:35.530
So this property called reviews is going to
contain a number of reviews given to us by

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:37.240
the parent.

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:42.680
In our current application we’re displaying
the number of book reviews in our template

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:48.899
using book.bookReviews and property in our
class looks like this.

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:54.810
Now the way we’re able to gain reference
to bookReviews in our child component is by

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.240
creating a binding inside of our child selector.

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:06.150
So inside our parentComponent html file here
we add in our child selector referencing the

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:10.700
child component and then add a binding.

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:18.000
We wrap the reviews property we defined in
square brackets and then set it equal to a

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.250
value inside the parent.

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:27.530
So now our reviews child property has been
assigned the value of bookReviews.

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:34.230
And this means that inside of our child html
file we can now reference the reviews property

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.879
which is going to be populated with parent
value.

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:43.090
So if we we’re using interpolation here,
we would see the number 15 displayed in our

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:44.580
child template.

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.230
Lets now practice using Inputs inside of our
application.
