00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:04.830
Ok, so lets practice adding inputs to our
application.

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.300
For this and the next example, I’m going
to be using a favorites component.

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.060
So lets go ahead and create that, and I’m
going to create it in our app folder.

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:18.340
I’ll say new folder and we’re going to
name this favorites.

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:23.090
Then inside of our favorites folder I’m
going to create a typescript file and an html

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:24.090
file.

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.590
So I’ll right-click that and say new file.

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:33.230
And we’re going to name this favorite.component.ts.

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:36.570
Create another new file which will be favorite.component.html.

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:43.070
I’m going to start in my html file.

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:49.760
I’m going to add just a simple tag in order
to make sure that this component is working.

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.830
So we’ll just say ‘hello world’ here.

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:57.210
Now I’ll go back into the favorite component
and add our setup code.

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:06.860
We’re going to be importing both component
and input, and this is going to be from angular/core.

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:13.650
Next, I’m going to export our class.

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:19.260
And the name of our class is going to be FavoriteComponent.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.250
And then we’ll go ahead and create our component
decorator.

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.190
And first we’ll say moduleId is module.id.

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:34.560
Next, we’ll declare a selector which is
going to be called bs-favorite.

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:40.030
And then finally, we’ll list our templateUrl
which is located in the same folder and is

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:45.810
called favorite.component.html.

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:51.100
The next thing I’ll do is add this comonent
into our app module declarations.

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:59.020
Opening up my app.module.ts file, just going
to copy this over and change this around.

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:10.969
So we’re going to be in the favorites folder
and this will be our favorite component.

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:15.080
And this is called FavoriteComponent is our
class.

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:21.659
And then we’ll make sure to add this to
our array of declarations as FavoriteComponent.

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:25.819
Now I just want to test out that our favorite
component is working and to do that I’ll

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:29.239
open up our books-list.html file.

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:35.639
And I’m going to add our favorite component
child selector right below this div row say

00:02:35.639 --> 00:02:38.209
div container.

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:45.620
Then inside here, we’ll say bs-favorite
which is the name of the selector.

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:50.439
And I’m going to save this and we should
expect to see the ‘hello world’ we defined

00:02:50.439 --> 00:02:53.629
in our html file to appear below the row.

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:56.079
So I’ll save that.

00:02:56.079 --> 00:02:59.319
Take a look at our application, you can see
that we’re getting ‘hello world’ as

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:01.420
we expected.

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.459
Now lets go ahead and add our input.

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:11.959
So inside our favorite component I’m going
to declare our Input by using our @ declaration

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:17.290
and the property that I want to create is
called reviews which is of type number.

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:24.349
And now we can use this reviews inside of
the booksList html file right inside of where

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:26.339
our selector is.

00:03:26.339 --> 00:03:31.870
So what we need to do first is wrap our property
in square brackets and then we need to set

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:35.010
it equal to a value inside of the parent.

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:42.049
We can choose really any of these book title,
book author, book description, but since we

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:50.760
want to show reviews we’ll say book.bookReviews
and we’ll go ahead and save this.

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:56.120
But what I haven’t done is I haven’t used
this reviews property in the favorite component

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.370
html file just yet.

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:04.159
So what we can do is use this however we want
and we’ll use interpolation.

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:09.889
So now we should expect to see ‘hello world’
and then a number of reviews which will be

00:04:09.889 --> 00:04:11.010
the number 15.

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:15.950
Lets go ahead and save that and look at our
application.

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:20.410
Its actually not appearing and if I look at
the console we’re getting an error and its

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:24.200
saying cannot read property ‘bookReviews’
of undefined.

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:32.730
So the reason is if we go back into our booksList
html, is that we haven’t yet declared what

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:34.500
bookReviews is.

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:42.100
This is outside of the div where our ngFor
is defining what bookReviews actually is,

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:44.510
so that’s why we get the error.

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:56.100
So what we can do is cut this and I’m going
to paste this right below the ngFor.

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:02.320
By pasting this right below the ngFor which
defines this book.bookReviews now this should

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:03.320
work.

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:07.060
Go head and save that.

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:11.970
When we reload our application we can see
we are now getting the interpolated value

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:14.850
15 inside of our child component.
