00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:05.800
Now lets do something a little more interesting
using our output and input events.

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:11.230
In this video we’re going to use our already
created favorite component to add some new

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:13.190
functionality to our application.

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:20.160
We’re going to add a heart icon that when
hovered over displays the book title our row

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.820
and when clicked on turns red and displays
the message ‘the favorite of the book we’ve

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:30.660
selected has been saved’.

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.609
Back in our editor the first thing I’m going
to do is add a new css class.

00:00:34.609 --> 00:00:39.609
In our styles.css class I’m going to open
that up and I’m going to add a new selector

00:00:39.609 --> 00:00:41.980
named faveSelected.

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:47.250
It’s going to turn our heart icon from black
to red when its clicked.

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.069
So we’ll say color red.

00:00:50.069 --> 00:00:51.069
Save that.

00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:54.469
Now, lets go into our favorites component.

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:58.550
And we’re going to leave this input reviews
here because its going to display the number

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:00.929
of reviews next to our icon.

00:01:00.929 --> 00:01:04.440
I’m actually going to add one more of these.

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:10.080
We’ll say @Input and this is going to be
our favorite, so our favorite is going to

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.360
hold the title of our book.

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:19.659
We’ll change this notify and call it favoriteClicked.

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:25.350
So when our favorite heart icon gets clicked
this is going to send a message up into the

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.170
parent.

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:33.190
Now we’ll change the this.notify into our
favoriteClicked – and we’ll change this

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:34.190
message.

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:41.750
The message we’re going to send is The favorite…
and what we can do inside of string interpolation

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:43.920
is grab variables.

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:51.210
So, if we say $ then put in these curly braces,
we’re able to grab this property.

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.329
We can say this.favorite just like that, was
saved.

00:01:56.329 --> 00:02:03.780
The one thing right here is these are apostrophies,
and instead of apostrophies we need to use

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.320
backticks, which is located at the upper left
corner of your keyboard.

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:12.530
So, I’m going to change those to backticks,
and then you can see that this interpolation

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:13.810
now has changed.

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:20.090
We’re going to grab the book title, which
is our favorite and display it right within

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:21.090
the string message.

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:26.460
I’m going to save that, and now lets open
up our html file.

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:30.349
And I’m going to add some new html here,
so we’ll get rid of that.

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:34.760
Lets make a new div and call this div fave.

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.790
Then inside I’m going to make an h3 tag.

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:43.660
This will say Add to Favorite the book that
they selected.

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.769
And here we’re going to add favicon icons.

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:51.430
This is going to be i.fa.fa-heart.

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.900
And its going to add our heart icon.

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:00.560
Then next to our heart icon I’m also going
to display our reviews.

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.250
This is going to be from the input.

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:10.950
We’ll add a little bit of space saying &amp;nbsp;
and then reviews.

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.629
Inside our div class is where we’ll add
our trigger.

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:19.840
So, we’ll do 2 things – first we’ll
interpolate the reviews as the title, and

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.709
this is going to appear when we hover over
the heart icon.

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:26.629
We’re going to set it equal to the favorite.

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:29.280
So again, this is going to be the bookTitle.

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:35.420
Then we’ll also add our click trigger, so
on click we’re going to set it to the method

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:38.410
that we created which was onClick.

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:43.540
We’ll save that and now lets open up our
books-list component file.

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:48.170
Let’s get rid of this showMessage because
we don’t need it anymore.

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:52.590
And instead here I’m going to say favoriteMessage
and this is what’s going to be displayed

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:55.870
when the user clicks on our heart.

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:58.830
And this is going to be a string and for now
we’re going to set it to empty.

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:00.560
Lets go down a little bit.

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.690
We’ll get rid of this onNotifyClicked.

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:08.579
I’m going to add one more book here just
so we can see the difference when we’re

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:10.430
clicking on one book vs the other.

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:14.290
I’ll just copy this over, add a comma.

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:20.590
We’ll change Tom to Mike, change to war
and peace 3, and change the price.

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:27.020
Change this around a little bit, say book
reviews 18, and we’ll use the same image.

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:30.020
Lets save this for now and go ahead and edit
our html file.

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:36.940
We’ll change showMessage here and instead
just say favoriteMessage.

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:41.030
Now I’m going to cut this out and paste
it where it should be displayed.

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:44.150
This is going to go at the bottom of our row.

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:52.789
We’ll put it right below this booksInStock.

00:04:52.789 --> 00:04:57.470
First off, remember we’re still sending
back our reviews, which is going to be displayed

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:02.200
in the child html, and we can send back more
then one thing.

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:05.310
We’re also going to be sending back into
our child the favorite.

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:10.150
So we’ll say favorite and we’re going
to set this equal to book.bookTitle to send

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:12.229
back our title of the book.

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:17.539
And instead of notify, we renamed this to
favoriteClicked.

00:05:17.539 --> 00:05:24.639
Instead of onNotifyClicked we’re going to
rename this to onFavoriteClicked.

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:29.580
This is still going to contain an event parameter
which is the message we received from the

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:31.100
child.

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:34.850
Now lets create this onFavoriteClicked method.

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:39.880
I’ll put this right above our toggleImage
method.

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:45.819
onFavoriteClicked accepts a parameter that
we’re going to name message is of type string

00:05:45.819 --> 00:05:48.030
and is not going to return anything.

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:52.930
And then we’ll just set our favoriteMessage
equal to the message.

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:58.300
I’m going to hit save all and lets take
a look at our application.

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:05.090
Our new component stuff is right here, so
if we click this we can see our message.

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:10.360
Favorite war and peace 2 was saved, so its
grabbing the title war and peace 2 and its

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:12.240
displaying the message right here.

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:18.750
If we click this other heart we get the message
corresponding to the appropriate book.

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:22.819
The last thing I want to show you is how to
change the color of this heart.

00:06:22.819 --> 00:06:28.100
One way to do that is to use the ngClass,
which we talked about in a previous section.

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:33.500
There’s another way to do this which might
be simpler and that is to use the class attribute

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:37.669
in html and then add it to the i class right
here.

00:06:37.669 --> 00:06:40.410
So I’ll just open up this ending div.

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:46.710
What we can do is say class, then the name
of the selector we want to use.

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:51.069
We created a new selector called faveSelected.

00:06:51.069 --> 00:06:55.360
Then we can set it equal to a method that’s
going to be of a boolean value.

00:06:55.360 --> 00:07:01.610
So, we’ll just say isSelected, and then
we pass in the property we want to watch for.

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:03.410
The property that we’ll create is called
fave.

00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:09.509
When fave is set to true, the class faveSelected
is going to show.

00:07:09.509 --> 00:07:15.740
When fave is set to false, this class of faveSelected
will not show.

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:20.500
The first thing we can do is we can create
a new property called fave and set it to false,

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:24.100
so we get the default coloring of our heart
icon.

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:30.629
I will create our new property of fave which
is a boolean and its going to be set to default

00:07:30.629 --> 00:07:33.300
to false.

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:37.270
Now when we click the icon, we’re going
to set this to true.

00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:42.009
We can say this.fave is equal to true.

00:07:42.009 --> 00:07:45.690
And then we have to create the method for
isSelected.

00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:51.060
We can say isSelected which takes the fave
property which is of type boolean is going

00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:53.129
to return true or false.

00:07:53.129 --> 00:08:02.289
So we’ll say when fave is false or this.fave
is false then return false.

00:08:02.289 --> 00:08:07.770
But if fave is true, then return true.

00:08:07.770 --> 00:08:12.139
And this was a mistake, this.fave we’re
not going to set it to true because then we

00:08:12.139 --> 00:08:13.610
can reset it.

00:08:13.610 --> 00:08:17.820
So in order to reset it we’ll flip it, just
like we did with the image.

00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:20.180
We’ll just say this dot not fave.

00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:23.590
This will toggle between true and false when
clicked.

00:08:23.590 --> 00:08:25.690
Then save all.

00:08:25.690 --> 00:08:32.450
And lets open up our app, click this button,
and now we get our heart turned red.

00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:36.450
And when we unclick it, turns back to black.

00:08:36.450 --> 00:08:37.330
And the same with the other one.
