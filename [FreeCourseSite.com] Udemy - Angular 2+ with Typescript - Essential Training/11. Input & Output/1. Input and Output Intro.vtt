Hello and welcome back to Angular 2 essential
training.

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:10.620
In this section we’re going to be talking
about how to use Inputs and Outputs to pass

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:17.610
data between our parent/child components . In
doing so, we’ll discuss some very important

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:24.740
subjects which include: what makes up a nested
component, how to use the Input and Output

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:26.070
decorators.

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:32.720
And how to create custom events and then bind
to their output using the EventEmitter.

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:39.120
I’ll be presenting these concepts first
in slides and then inside of our application.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.079
Our main example is going to be a Favorite
Component that’s going to allow us to click

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:48.039
a heart icon in order to save a book as a
favorite.

00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:52.960
I’ll make sure to go slow and present these
ideas thoroughly since this section can be

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.530
a bit confusing.

00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:00.120
So I encourage you to code along with me and
then practice on your own editing and testing

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.539
out these different features.
