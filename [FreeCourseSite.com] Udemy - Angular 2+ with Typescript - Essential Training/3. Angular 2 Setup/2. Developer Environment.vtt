00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:07.180
Lets now discuss what our developer environment
needs to be in order to develop Angular 2

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:08.180
applications.

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:11.219
There’s 3 main things you need to get going.

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.620
First, you need Node.js installed.

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:19.621
Second, you need a text editor like Sublime
Text or Visual Studio and third you need to

00:00:19.621 --> 00:00:20.920
install a few plugins.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:25.120
I’m using Node version 6.9.1.

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:32.270
Its recommended that you use at least version
4 and every odd number version gets longer-term

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:33.650
support.

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:38.010
Node version 6 will have long term support
until April 2018.

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.280
Once you’ve downloaded the vesion right
for your system, you’ll be able to open

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:51.110
up a node terminal window and check your versioning
using the node -v flag as well as npm which

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:53.489
is used to download our dependencies.

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.290
Next comes selecting an editor.

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:01.920
Some good editor’s for angular projects
include visual studio, sublime text, brackets

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.299
and webstorm.

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:07.490
For all of these except webstorm, you’ll
need add in a typescript plugin.

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.320
I’m using sublime text so I’ll show how
to do this here.

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.830
First we need to download package control.

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:20.970
And once that’s installed you can type:
Ctrl + shift + P to bring up the search bar.

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.780
Then click install packages then search for
typescript.

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.070
Its already configured in my editor so its
not coming up.

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:34.010
But once installed, you’ll have access to
features like error checking, auto-completion,

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:37.770
auto suggestions and a tyepscript compiler.

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.860
We want to be able to compile typescript from
the command line and pull down typings type

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:44.270
definitions.

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:51.940
So inside of our terminal we’ll type ‘npm
install typescript typings -g’.

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:56.750
The dash g flag will download a local version
of each of these libraries.

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.350
Back in our code we now have typescript support.

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.440
So when opening up our app component files
we can test this out.

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:09.819
When adding a comma P to our import we are
suggested Pipe.

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:14.750
And if we comment out this line, we’ll get
a squiggly line error under our component

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:15.780
decorator.

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:21.290
These are a couple quick examples of the enhanced
error checking and auto completion features

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:22.590
that are already built in.
