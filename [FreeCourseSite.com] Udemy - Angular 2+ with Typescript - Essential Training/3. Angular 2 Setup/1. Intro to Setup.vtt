00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:05.500
Hello and welcome to the section on setting
up an Angular 2 application.

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:11.260
In this section, we’ll discuss what our
developer environment needs to be to get started

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:13.400
building awesome Angular applications.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:19.320
We’ll look into the different types of text
editors and plugins best suited to developing

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.360
our apps.

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:25.530
Then we’ll get going building a new app
by following the example provided to us by

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:29.750
the team at angular.io in the Quickstart section.

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:34.679
This will be fairly brief in order to get
you up and running but feel free to visit

00:00:34.679 --> 00:00:40.280
the ‘Setup Revisited’ section for a full
explanation of the code and files.
