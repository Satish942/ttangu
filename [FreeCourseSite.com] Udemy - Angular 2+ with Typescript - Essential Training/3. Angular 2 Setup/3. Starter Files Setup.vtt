00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:02.110
Welcome to the setup video.

00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:05.130
In this video I’m going to walk you through
getting setup with our starting code.

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.390
There’s 2 ways you can go about starting
a new project.

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:13.889
The first way is to install the Angular CLI
tool, which is a command line interface for

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.660
generating new applications and can be found
here at cli.angular.io.

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:25.410
What you do is first download the CLI through
your terminal and then you can use these easy

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:26.840
commands to create new projects.

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:28.080
This looks like an amazing tool that’s still
being developed but I encourage you to check

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.080
it out and see what their generated code looks
like.

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:32.689
The second way is to download or clone some
starter code such as the code given to us

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:34.000
by angular.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.730
The link to official starter template can
be found in the setup portion of the Guide

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.120
at angular.io.

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.360
Angular tells us that we can either clone
or download to get going.

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.280
So this code here in the angular repo is almost
the same as what I’m supplying you with

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:56.440
both in the resources section of this lecture
as well as in my repo in the starter folder

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.960
at jakblak/learn-angular-2.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:05.080
The only main difference will be how updated
the package.json file is, as Angular works

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.860
to keep pushing out new updates.

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.860
When we open the starter folder it looks like
this.

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.400
Using this setup we only need to do 2 things
to get going.

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.770
First, we navigate to the location of our
folder in our terminal and type the command

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.070
‘npm install’.

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.880
This will download all of the dependencies
that we need in order get going.

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.590
And once everything has finished downloading,
we then type ‘npm start’.

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.670
This will load up our starter application
in a browser.

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:40.390
This will also enable live reloading, so that
when make a change to our code and save the

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:47.710
file, our code gets re-compiled and changes
automatically refreshed inside the browser.

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:53.710
The code that’s making this happen is located
inside the package.json file at the top under

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:54.820
scripts.

00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:00.650
Along with starting up our app inside a browser
and enabling live reloading, this script is

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:04.490
also compiles our typescript into javascript
files.

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:10.720
So for every typescript file there is a corresponding
ES5 javascript file.

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:16.099
And these javascript files are the ones that
are being loaded up and read by the browser.

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:20.540
Besides that, there’s quite a bit going
on inside of these starter files.

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:26.120
So I’ve moved all further explanations of
what these files do inside of the last section

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.050
in this course entitled Setup Revisited.
