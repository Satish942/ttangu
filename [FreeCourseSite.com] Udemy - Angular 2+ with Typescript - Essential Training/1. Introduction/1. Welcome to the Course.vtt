Hello everyone and welcome to the course Angular
2 Essential Training.

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:11.010
I hope you are just as excited as I am to
learn about and create awesome applications

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.590
using the brand new Angular 2 framework.

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:20.439
This is a beginner level course and will assume
no prior experience to using either Angular

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:26.150
version 1 or 2 or any experience with typescript.

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:30.259
You should however, have a basic understanding
of Javascript.

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:35.930
This would include how to work with things
such as variables, objects, and arrays.

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:43.030
I structured this course by first presenting
a key Angular 2 concept using powerpoint slides,

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.550
and then working through an example in our
sample application.

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.850
And then providing quizzes to re-inforce what
you’ve learned.

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.740
The application we’ll build is a Book store.

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:59.260
Users will be able to add to favorite the
book of their choice and can also click through

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.710
to see the book details.

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.610
Project files will be included in all lectures
where we work on app.

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:13.000
And I’ve also set up a github repo, which
is located at github.com / jakblak / learn

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.670
angular 2.

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.640
By the end of the course you will be familiar
with all of the important features in building

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:28.350
Angular 2 applications including: The Typescript
language, Components, NgModules, Data Binding,

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:35.990
Directives, Pipes, handling Inputs and Outputs,
Observables, and Routing.

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.909
Additionally, I plan on keeping this course
up to date by adding new content as the Angular

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:42.760
team releases new updates.
