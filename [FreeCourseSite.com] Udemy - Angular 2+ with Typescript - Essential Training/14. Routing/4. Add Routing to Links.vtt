00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:06.660
Now lets see how to add routing to links in
our app using the routerLink directive.

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.809
And all we need to do is use routerLink to
bind to whichever route want shown.

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:17.160
So you can think of the routerLink as a replacement
for the href tag.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.500
The trickiest part about this is remembering
to wrap the link location first in double

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.670
quotes, then brackets, and then again in single
quotes.

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:35.340
Here, we’re saying bind the menu link of
All Books to the route we defined in our app.module

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.550
file called books.

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:43.399
And when the link is clicked it takes us to
our localhost:3000/books.

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:46.220
So lets open our app.component html file.

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:53.300
We’ll scroll down a bit and edit our navbar
All Books link so that we’re using our routerLink

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.330
and binding to our books route.

00:00:55.330 --> 00:01:01.090
Now, as you may recall – we’re already
using this books route as the default view

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:03.360
when a user enters our app.

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:08.829
So lets instead make books a route that we
can navigate to by clicking a button or this

00:01:08.829 --> 00:01:09.829
nav menu link.

00:01:09.829 --> 00:01:11.510
This means we’ll be adding a new HomeComponent
to display when a user first enters the application.

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:13.200
So here’s a challenge for you.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.880
See if can create a new component named HomeComponent.

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.109
Then make HomeComponent the default view when
a user enters your app.

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:30.130
And also set up new links to both our All
Books route when a user clicks a button as

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.289
well as our home route in the nav menu.

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:38.579
You could use something like a bootstrap jumbotron
for the home.component html file and then

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.859
edit this button link to navigate to our books
route when clicked.
