00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:05.520
Hello, and welcome back to Angular 2 essential
training.

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.490
In this section we’ll be discussing routing.

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.940
Routing is what happens when we move from
one page on our site to another.

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:18.580
This could be triggered by button clicks,
clicks on a navigation menu, or code redirections.

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:24.940
We’ll start this section off by going through
how to build a simple routing implementation

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:29.490
sending the user to our main page using the
router-outlet.

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.860
Then we’ll see how to use the routerLink
to send users to a new page whenever they

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.860
click on links such as a navigation menu or
buttons.

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:44.440
Finally, we’ll see how to pass parameters
to our routes so that we can navigate to an

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:45.930
individual book.

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:52.820
While doing so, we’ll build out a new books-details
component to render specific book details.
