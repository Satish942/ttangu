00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:05.470
Back in our app, the first thing I’ll do
is if you haven’t already done so is fix

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:10.140
this api link so it correctly grabs my books.json
file.

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:15.230
The next thing is I’m going to add my base
href to the index file right below the opening

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:17.060
head tag.

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:20.289
With that done, we can get to work on adding
routing.

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:27.170
So lets open up the app.module file and we’ll
start off by importing RouterModule from angular/router.

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:34.300
Next, we’ll add in our RouterModule to our
list of imports.

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:40.890
Then we’ll say dot forRoot in order to declare
an array of paths for our routes.

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:48.710
The first route will be named books and is
going to use our BooksListComponent.

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:54.600
The next route is going to be an empty string,
which says anytime a user navigates to the

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:00.010
root index of our app, take them route named
books.

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:07.470
We also need to include a path match property
with a value of full whenever using redirection.

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:13.030
And our last route is going to be a wildcard,
saying if a user navigates to a route that

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:18.970
isn’t defined, then just redirect them back
to our books route.

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:21.400
Now we need to add our router outlet.

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:25.360
Lets open up our app.component.html file.

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.600
The html at the top here is for our menu items.

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.670
Lets scroll down to the bottom.

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:38.270
You can see here that we’ve added this bs-books-list
selector in order to display our BooksListComponent

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:39.270
html.

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.409
But now, since we’re using a router, to
display this content, we can just get rid

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:48.700
of that selector and instead use the router-outlet
selector.

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:55.030
And that’s it, if you reload your app now
no visible changes will be seen, but we have

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.640
successfully implemented routing.

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.350
One more thing we should do is inside the
BooksListComponent typescript file.

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.210
And since we’re using routing, we don’t
need to have this selector definition.

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:13.359
And a good rule of thumb here is we only need
to use selectors inside a component when the

00:02:13.359 --> 00:02:16.790
component is nested inside of another component.
