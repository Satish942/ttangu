00:00:04.299 --> 00:00:05.299
Then I added 2 new files.

00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:09.760
A welcome.component.ts file and a welcome.component.html
file.

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:14.340
I added in the minimal amount of code needed
to make this component functional.

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.779
And I also omitted a selector because I know
this component is going to be appearing inside

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:21.880
our router-outlet.

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:27.759
Inside of my corresponding html file I added
a jumbotron which was taken from the bootstrap

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:30.919
website and slightly modified the text.

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:34.930
Along with the button in order to navigate
to our books route.

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:43.379
I then opened my app.module file and imported
my new WelcomeComponent and added it to my

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.870
list of declarations.

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.440
Inside my imports I added a new route here
with a path called welcome attaching to it

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.410
my WelcomeComponent.

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:59.829
I then modified my entry point and wildcard
to redirect to my welcome route.

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:06.460
Then inside my app.component html file, I
set my Home link to use my router and sending

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.400
the user to the welcome route.

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:14.660
With our new routing setup we are now able
to navigate from the welcome page to our books

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:16.800
list page.

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:21.320
So that does it for our basic routing setup,
in the next lecture weâ€™ll discuss how to

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:26.090
send parameters to our route so that we can
navigate to single book pages.
