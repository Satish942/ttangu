00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:06.250
In the previous section you learned how to
setup a new angular project.

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:13.059
While doing this, we used NgModule to assist
in setting up and managing our application.

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:18.830
In this section we’ll be discussing NgModule
in depth so that you better understand this

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:19.970
core utility.

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:27.090
We’ll start off with an overview of NgModule
decorator class and what goes inside of it.

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:33.770
Then we’ll learn how we use NgModule to
load up all our components, pipes and services

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:36.970
that are used throughout our application.

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:43.040
And finally, we’ll see how our application
is bootstrapped and launched using NgModule

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:44.870
and our root module file.
