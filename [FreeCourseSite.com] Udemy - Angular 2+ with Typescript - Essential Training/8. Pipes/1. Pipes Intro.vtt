Hello and welcome back to Angular 2 essential
training.

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:08.220
In this section weâ€™ll discuss pipes.

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.800
Pipes allow us to transform or format our
data.

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:17.940
In this way we can take data given to us by
an API or database and make it more appropriate

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.820
for our needs inside of our application.

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:27.110
Angular provides us with a number of built-in
pipes that we can easily use within our HTML

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:28.280
templates.

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:34.280
We do so by adding in a pipe character and
then the name of the built-in pipe.

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:40.480
We can also create custom pipes to perform
a specific kind of data transformation.

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:45.700
When we use custom pipes in our app we use
the pipe character followed by the name of

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:46.550
our custom pipe.
