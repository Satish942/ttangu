00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:06.500
In this video we’ll explore what built-in
pipes are and how we can use them inside our

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:08.550
application.

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:14.290
Angular provides us with some built-in pipes
that we can easily use inside of our templates.

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:21.779
These include: uppercase, lowercase, decimal,
currency, date and JSON.

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.560
Using pipes in our app is pretty easy.

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:30.849
All we need to is add this pipe character
inside of our curly braces and then specify

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:34.070
what type of pipe we want to use.

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:39.610
In this example, we’re using the uppercase
pipe that will then transform our data into

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:44.150
all capital letters when displayed in our
HTML layout.

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:50.580
Lets now explore how to use a few of these
pipes inside of our application.

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:56.780
Opening our DevBooks folder I’ll open up
the BooksList component and make a few adjustments

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:58.310
to our books array.

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:05.819
I’m going to change the price property here
to display a number, add then add a publishedOn

00:01:05.819 --> 00:01:08.820
property equaling a new date.

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.259
This Date object is native to javascript.

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:20.179
I’m also going to add an inStock property
and set it equal to yes.

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:25.159
Now lets edit our books-list html file.

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:27.320
Now lets start using our builtin pipes.

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:34.020
I’ll start off by adding a pipe next to
this book.price and then use our currency

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.289
pipe.

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:39.990
With this pipe we do need to add an additional
property indicating what kind of currency

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:45.840
to use, to do that we’ll add a colon then
specify USD.

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.539
In order to display a dollar sign we need
to add another parameter that’s a boolean.

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:54.609
The default is set to False, meaning do not
show a symbol.

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:58.090
We can change that default by setting it to
‘true’.

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:05.950
Next, lets add a pipe to format our publishedOn
property.

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.900
To do that, we’ll first specify that we
want to use the date pipe.

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:14.390
And then we’re going to set it to longDate.

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:20.830
And you have different options here when using
this date pipe, you can set it equal to longDate,

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:26.480
shortDate, shortTime, longTime, year as well
as a few others.

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:32.390
To find out more about these different pipe
options you can always google ‘angular 2

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:39.020
date pipes’ then you can click here on this
angular.io link and then right here you’ll

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:42.510
be presented with the different options you
have.

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:47.980
I’m also going to use a pipe to make my
inStock property uppercase.

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.980
So I’ll go ahead and add my pipe character
in here, then specify that I want to use the

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:58.650
uppercase pipe which is going to capitalize
the yes string that we’ve defined.

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:04.000
Lets save that and head over to our app and
here you can see that our newly added pipes

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.040
are working properly.

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:13.890
If instead we wanted to display Euro dollars
instead of US dollars we can just change USD

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:21.370
to EUR save, refresh our app, and we can see
that the change has been updated within our

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:22.030
application.
