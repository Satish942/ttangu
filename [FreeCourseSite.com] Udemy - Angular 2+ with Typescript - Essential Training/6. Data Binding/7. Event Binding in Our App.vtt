00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:07.240
Back in our app we’re going to create event
binding to toggle between showing or hiding

2
00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:08.390
one of our images.

3
00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:13.250
So let’s start by opening up our books-list.html
file.

4
00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:17.400
We’ll add a button that’s going to trigger
our click event.

5
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:24.290
We’ll use a bootstrap class for styling
and then create our click event setting it

6
00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:31.510
equal to a method we’ll define in our class
named toggleImage.

7
00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:38.899
Now switching back into our class we’ll
first add a property named showImage which

8
00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:43.309
will be a boolean and set to true.

9
00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:46.670
Now we’ll create our toggleImage method.

10
00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:56.239
The logic inside the method will toggle the
image to show or hide when our button is clicked.

11
00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:01.489
And the last thing we need to do is connect
our showImage property to an image we want

12
00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:05.390
to toggle in the view.

13
00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.430
We can use the ngIf directive here.

14
00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.000
This will check the boolean value of our property.

15
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:19.080
So if our showImage property is set to true,
as it is in the default, our image will appear.

16
00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.200
If the showImage property is set to false
then it will not appear.

17
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.950
Directives like this ngIf will be discussed
in detail in the next section.

18
00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:35.310
Now we can go ahead and test out our new feature.

19
00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.580
And you can see we are able to toggle our
image on and off.

20
00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:50.240
One small enhancement we can make here is
to add interpolation with our property.

21
00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:58.990
This is a terniary which checks whether or
not something is true.

22
00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:05.050
So if showImage is true then the text Hide
Image will appear in the button and if showImage

23
00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:14.730
is false then the text Show Image will be
shown in the button.

24
00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.560
And on save you can see that our hide and
show text is being updated.
