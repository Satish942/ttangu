00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:06.810
The last type of data binding that we need
to talk about is event binding.

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.299
Event binding is used to respond to user actions.

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:15.739
So for example, when a user clicks on a button
we want to perform some action.

00:00:15.739 --> 00:00:21.630
That action could be to display some content,
fire off an ajax request, or to update some

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.060
property.

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:28.760
When performing event binding, we start inside
of our template and wrap the event name we’re

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.820
targeting inside of parenthesis.

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:37.730
And then we need to set our event equal to
the name of a method statement inside of quotes

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.629
that is also invoked using parenthesis.

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:47.819
Method statements are located inside of our
class and are defined below our properties.

00:00:47.819 --> 00:00:54.210
In this example we’ll be showing or hiding
an image based on the click of a button.

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:00.319
Notice how we’ve set our hideImage method
to be of type void meaning the method will

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:02.769
not have a return value.

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:05.720
In this example we’re using the click event.

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:11.640
We’re actually able to bind to any of the
standard web events provided to us within

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:12.640
the browser.

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:18.030
To find about all the different events that
we can bind to, you can navigate over to the

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.720
mozilla docs slash web slash events.

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:27.910
And you can scroll down on this page to check
out all the different events available.

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:33.420
Lets now implement event binding inside our
application.
