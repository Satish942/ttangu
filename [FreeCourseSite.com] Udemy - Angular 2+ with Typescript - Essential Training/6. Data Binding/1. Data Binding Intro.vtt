00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:05.960
In this section we’re going to be discussing
data binding in Angular.

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:10.700
Data binding is the mechanism that we use
for communicating between the template and

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:12.860
the component class.

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:18.550
After defining our properties and methods
inside of our class we’re then able to use

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:24.510
special syntax in our template in order to
display data and process any changes that

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.170
are made to that data.

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:31.720
There are 3 different types of binding that
we can use.

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:37.340
The first is one way binding – which takes
our declared class properties and displays

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:44.820
them using curly brackets, next we have 2-way
binding which allows users to update the model

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.910
and is used places like input boxes and form
fields.

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:56.489
And finally we have Event binding – which
takes users actions such as clicks on buttons

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.449
and then performs some action or logic defined
within a method.

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:05.560
Lets now see how each one of these works inside
of our application.
