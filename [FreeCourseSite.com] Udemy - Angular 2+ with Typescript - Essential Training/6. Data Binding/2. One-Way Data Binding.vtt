00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:06.010
The fist type of data binding we’ll discuss
is that of 1-way binding.

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:11.210
One way binding is handled using either interpolation
or property binding.

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:17.340
When using interpolation, we pass our class
property into our template using the double

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:18.580
curly braces.

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:24.140
We’ve already explored this type of binding
in our application when we bound our pageTitle

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:26.700
property inside our template.

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:33.200
We defined a string called Dev Book Store
inside of our pageTitle property which then

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.210
appeared inside of our template.

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.829
We can also accomplish 1-way binding using
property binding.

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:47.219
When using property binding we use brackets
around the element we want to bind to.

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:53.310
Then we can define a property in our class
that will contain the data we want to use.

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:58.180
And we make sure to wrap the property element
inside of quotation marks.

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:03.860
In this example we’ve defined a class with
a property of bookImageUrl.

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:09.090
This matches a property that we’ve set up
within our component, which then points to

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.470
the location of an image file.

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:17.840
Now that we’ve seen examples of 1-way binding,
lets now use these inside of our application.
