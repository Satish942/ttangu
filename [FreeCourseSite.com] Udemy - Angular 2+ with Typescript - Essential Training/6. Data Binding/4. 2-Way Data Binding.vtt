00:00:01.329 --> 00:00:06.250
The next type of binding we need to talk about
is that of 2-way binding.

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:10.060
When using 2-way binding our view is bound
to our model.

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:15.710
So that whenever any changes are to the view
they are reflected back to the user.

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:21.580
You’ll see this commonly used in input boxes
as well as in form fields.

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:28.970
2-way binding is achieved by enclosing a special
directive called ngModel in both square brackets

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:30.810
and parenthesis.

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:36.510
The square brackets are used to indicate property
binding from the class property to the view

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:37.510
element.

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:44.370
And the parenthesis are used to send a notification
back to the class property that the user has

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.480
entered some data.

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.330
This is sometimes referred to as a Banana
in a Box.

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:53.360
Since that’s kinda what it looks like.

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.750
2-way binding uses the NgModel directive.

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:58.590
This directive is part of the FormsModule.

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:05.860
And as such, it is required for us to add
the FormsModule to our appModule file as part

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:11.750
of the imports array before we’re actually
able to use NgModel within our application.

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.960
Now that we’ve seen the steps involved within
2-way binding, lets try this out inside of

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:17.490
our app.
