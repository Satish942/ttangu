00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:06.590
Switching now back into our app, I’m going
to add our 2-way binding into the search field

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:09.180
right here.

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:15.230
So to do that I’m going to open up our app
component.ts file and first define a property

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:17.420
model to hold our search text.

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:24.289
So I’ll say searchBox is of type string
and set it equal to an empty string.

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:27.020
That’s it for the component.

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:32.050
And now we need to add the FormsModule to
our list of imports in the appModule file.

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:38.260
So navigating into our AppModule.ts file,
I’ll add in the FormsModule to our list

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:46.309
of imports and then also make sure we import
it from @angular/forms.

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:54.049
Now I’ll just add in my template binding
logic in the associated HTML file.

00:00:54.049 --> 00:01:01.179
I can do that by declaring my banana in a
box around our special ngModel directive.

00:01:01.179 --> 00:01:07.260
Then setting it equal to the property we defined
in our class which is searchBox.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:14.470
We also now actually have include a name attribute
within our HTML equal to our property.

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:19.360
This is something new to latest Angular 2
release, and if this name attribute is not

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:24.740
defined we will get an error and our template
won’t be displayed correctly.

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:30.140
One thing that’s cool is that we can this
2-way binding and display it in other areas

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.780
of our app using interpolation.

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:38.960
So to demonstrate I’m just going to create
a new link in our navBar and add in our property

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.190
searchBox inside of the double curly’s.

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:48.430
So I’ll save these now and head back over
to my app.

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:53.530
And I can test this out by adding in some
text to our search field.

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:58.130
And then we can see that both the 2-way binding
and interpolation is now working.
