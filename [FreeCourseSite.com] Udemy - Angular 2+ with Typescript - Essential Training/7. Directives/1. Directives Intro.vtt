Hello, and welcome back to Angular 2 Essential
training.

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:08.610
In this section we’ll be discussing directives.

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:14.009
You can think of a Directive in Angular as
an HTML element or attribute that is used

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.080
to extend and enhance our HTML.

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:21.340
There are 3 different types of directives
in Angular.

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:24.150
The first is Component Directives.

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.480
These are directives that have a template.

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:31.810
So any time that we create a component and
use its selector inside of our template, we

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:34.320
have created a component directive.

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.850
We’ve already used this type of directive
a couple times inside of our AppComponent

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.050
and BooksList Component.

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:49.829
The second type of directive is structural
directives, also known as Built-in directives.

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.110
These are directives that come pre-shipped
with Angular.

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:59.100
These types of directives change the DOM layout
by adding and removing DOM elements.

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.969
In the previous lesson we used the NgIf directive.

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:09.200
A few others we’ll look at in this section
include NgFor as well as NgStyle.

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.479
And the third type of directive is the attribute
directive.

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:17.860
Attribute directives change the appearance
or behavior of an element.

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:24.649
These are custom directives that are created
using a directive decorator and applied inside

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:25.889
html tags.
