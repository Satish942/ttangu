Welcome back to Angular 2 Essential Training.

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.860
In this video we’re going to go through
the process of creating a new nested component

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:11.700
to act as a directive.

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:17.250
As well as how to use templateUrl and styles
within our component.

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:23.460
Lets start out by going into our app folder
and create a new folder called welcome.

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.740
Inside this welcome folder I’m going to
add two new files.

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:29.560
The first one is called welcome.component.ts.

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:34.680
The second is called welcome.component.html.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:42.489
I’m also going to add in an assets folder
that contains a logo.jpg file inside an images

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:48.890
folder.

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.940
And these files can be found within your resources
files.

00:00:52.940 --> 00:01:01.390
Next, I’ll open up the welcome.html file
and paste in some html that can also be found

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.670
in your resources files.

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:07.150
Now, lets open our component file.

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:17.590
I’ll first create a class named WelcomeComponent
and add a single property named pageTitle

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:22.440
with a type of string and a default value
of ‘welcome’.

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.420
Next, I’ll create my component decorator.

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:35.760
We’ll include our metadata here, first adding
a selector with the value bs-welcome.

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:43.130
And now I’m going to add in a templateUrl
setting and define it as the location of our

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.180
welcome.component.html file.

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:51.130
This html file will now be associated to only
this component.

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:57.750
Notice the key templateUrl is different from
just that of template we defined in our AppComponent

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:58.840
file.

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:04.750
When assigning a templateUrl there is one
more step we need to take and that is to set

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:08.420
a moduleId of module.id.

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:13.819
This step is only needed when using SystemJS
as our module loader.

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:20.280
And also we’ll make sure to import our Component
from angular core.

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.200
Lets go back now and open up our WelcomeComponent
html file.

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.819
In this file we can see there is some bootstrap
styling defining a panel area along with an

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:34.269
instance of property binding for pageTitle.

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:39.680
So now that we setup our welcome component,
lets add this as a directive inside of our

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:40.680
AppComponent.

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.510
So there’s 2 steps involved in doing this.

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:51.389
The first is we need to add our WelcomeComponent
to the declarations array inside our AppModule

00:02:51.389 --> 00:02:53.079
file.

00:02:53.079 --> 00:03:00.540
And we need to make sure that we import it
within our file.

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:08.999
And now we can add our WelcomeComponent selector
inside the template area of our AppComponent.

00:03:08.999 --> 00:03:20.840
We’ll save all that and restart our application.

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:26.970
And now you can see that our welcome component
is being displayed inside of our AppComponent

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:28.359
within our application.

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:34.249
We’ll cover just one more aspect of components
here and that is how to add styling to our

00:03:34.249 --> 00:03:35.969
specific component.

00:03:35.969 --> 00:03:42.519
We’re able to isolate style selectors to
individual components one of two ways.

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:46.500
Either by defining styles within our decorator
like this.

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:53.340
Then adding our selectors inside of an array.

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:59.779
We need to add quotation marks here, and then
the syntax the same way we do as in a css

00:03:59.779 --> 00:04:00.779
file.

00:04:00.779 --> 00:04:05.819
I’ll flip over to my welcome.html file and
add a new class called byline.

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:10.760
So we’ll save this page and reload our app.

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:15.409
And now you can see that our text gets changed
to the color green.

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:20.519
You won’t usually see styles defined inline
within our component like this though.

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:25.729
The much more common way of declaring styles
is in its own css file.

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:31.169
So what we can do is add a new css file within
our welcome folder.

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:36.580
And we’ll call it welcome.component.css.

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:42.560
And then inside of our component we’ll change
the styles to styleUrls.

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:45.690
And then we’ll reference our new style sheet.

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:53.060
Then we’ll add our style definition to our
style sheet.

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:59.200
Then we can save these files and reload our
application.

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:06.120
Now you can see that our app hasn’t changed
but we are referencing our new css file.
