00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:06.140
In this video we’re going to be updating
our app so that it looks more like our sample

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:07.720
application.

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:10.620
This is what our application is going to look
like as we progress.

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:17.320
Its going to have a main page listing some
books, then an inner page containing the book

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:18.320
details.

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:23.159
So I’m just going to be walking you through
the changes that have already been made since

00:00:23.159 --> 00:00:29.660
they mostly involve adding some style references
and html references along with our images.

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:36.480
You’ll be able to find both the updated
code as well as the raw html e-commerce files

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.300
in your lecture resources.

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.460
I’m going to start off by editing our html
file.

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:44.609
So I’ll just open that up.

00:00:44.609 --> 00:00:51.879
And you can see in this file I’ve added
a reference to some fonts as well as fontawesome.

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:57.510
We’ll be using fontawesome to add in some
icons in certain places.

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.629
And one of the first places we use it is to
add in a spinner.

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:06.270
I’ve removed the text ‘loading’ when
our app is initially loaded, and instead we’ll

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.670
just display a spinner.

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:15.040
And I’ve edited our package.json down here
to include a reference to font-awesome.

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:22.190
So by including this font-awesome reference I can navigate into my
terminal and type ‘npm install’ and its

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:27.020
going to download this font-awesome library into our node_modules.

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.810
Which you can see righ there.

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.360
The next thing is I’ve added some images
into our assets folder.

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.970
So inside of our images I’ve added a bunch
of our books that will show up.

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:44.070
And I’ve also added a folder for fonts for
our glyphicons.

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.890
Additionally, I’ve added a books folder.

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:53.750
This books folder is going to have a books-details
folder and a books-list folder.

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.420
The books-list folder currently contains a
books-list typescript file and a books-list

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:59.420
html file.

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.590
The typescript file is empty.

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.390
And the html file is going to hold a list
of our products.

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.759
This is what will appear on the main page.

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:16.520
On the books-details we have an empty component
and the same thing we have an html page that

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.870
will contain the html.

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.890
Right now, both these files are hard-coded.

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:26.030
We’ll change that as we progress.

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:32.280
Inside of our styles.css file I’ve included
some styling that’s going to overwrite the

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.740
bootstrap styling.

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:40.560
So now, the last thing I want to do together
is within our app.component file I’m going

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.150
to add the header navbar area.

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:50.840
What we’ll do is add in this navbar area,
and then below that we’re going to nest

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.610
components to display our content.

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:58.350
I’ll add a new file into my app folder.

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:05.040
And we’ll call this app.component.html.

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.200
And then I’m going to paste in our code
here.

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.459
This is the header navbar code.

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:14.530
Then save that.

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:20.140
Then all we need to do is edit our component
typescript file and reference this component

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:21.700
html.

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:28.180
So I’ll change this to be templateUrl.

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:34.940
And I’ll change our backticks to quotes,
then just reference the file which is app.component.html.

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:47.720
If we’re referencing our template then we
also have to reference our moduleId as module.id.

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.440
Now I’ll save that file.

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:57.770
And I’m going to remove the welcome folder
since we’re not using it anymore.

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:05.300
The last thing we need to do is open up our
app.module.ts file and remove the WelcomeComponent

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:08.020
import.

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:13.600
We’ll get rid of that.

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:16.470
And now lets go ahead and restart our server.

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:26.680
Ok, so that’s all that I wanted to do in
this lecture was update our code to include

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.389
some new HTML files.

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:33.710
In the next section, we’ll discuss in detail
how to use angular data binding.
