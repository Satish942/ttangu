00:00:01.750 --> 00:00:06.930
In this video I’m going to show you how
hide our Javascript files from appearing in

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:08.299
the editor.

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:13.800
So when we’re compiling our typescript code,
we get 2 new files created for each one of

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:18.560
our typescript files that we don’t ever
actually use or edit.

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.610
These are the .js files and the .map.js files.

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:27.500
The process of hiding these files works in
a variety of text editors.

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.660
But since I’m using sublime text, I’m
going to show you how to do it just for my

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:33.110
editor.

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:36.440
So first we need to save our project.

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:44.170
I’ll navigate into the packages folder of
my sublime text and then save the project

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.989
with the name noJS.

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:53.890
Then once saved, I’ll click on this edit
project link.

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:59.090
This will take you to a file where you can
edit the preferences so that it only affects

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:01.850
this particular project.

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:08.520
So I just needed to add in this excludes patterns
and then specify an array of files that I

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.040
want to exclude.

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:19.060
Now once I save the file, you can see all
of our .js and .js.map files have been removed

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:20.290
just from the editor.
