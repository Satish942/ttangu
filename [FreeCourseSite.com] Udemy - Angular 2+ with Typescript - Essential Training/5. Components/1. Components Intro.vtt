00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:05.760
Components are at the heart of Angular 2.

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:11.330
In this section we’ll discuss the nuts and
bolts of creating these components.

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:18.010
This will include what’s involved in constructing
our component decorators and classes, how

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:24.510
we can create nested components that also
work as directives, and how we can define

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.929
styles and templates inside of our components.
