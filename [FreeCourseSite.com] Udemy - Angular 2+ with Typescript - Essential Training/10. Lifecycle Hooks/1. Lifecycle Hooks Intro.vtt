Hello and welcome back to Angular 2 Essential
Training.

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:10.260
In this section we’re going to be discussing
how to use Component Lifecycle Hooks.

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.450
We’ll start this section off with a definition
of what lifecycle hooks are.

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:23.650
Then we’ll explore the 3 most commonly used
lifecycle hooks – which are ngOnInit, ngOnChanges

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:28.239
and ngOnDestroy
Finally, we’ll work through a few examples

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:33.590
showing how we can use each one of these lifecycle
hooks within our application.
