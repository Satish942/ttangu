00:00:01.699 --> 00:00:07.479
Applications will usually get their data from
one of two places, either a local database

00:00:07.479 --> 00:00:09.040
or an outside API.

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:14.440
For this project, I’ve supplied you with
a JSON file that includes data you would typically

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.460
get back from either of these sources.

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.290
It is located in your api folder and is called
books.json.

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:27.810
If we open it up, you can see that it holds
all of the data that’s currently being hardcoded

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.940
into our application.

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:35.260
Lets now go ahead and create an interface
to strongly type this data.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:43.090
To do this we’ll add a new file into our
books folder named book.ts.

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:48.600
And this is the standard file naming convention
for interfaces, we just use the singular name

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.780
of the interface that we’re referencing.

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:57.649
Opening up this file, lets begin by making
sure that we export our interface so we can

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:00.180
use it in other files.

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.140
And then we’ll name our interface IBook.

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:10.009
Inside of our interface we’ll define the
types for each one of the properties listed

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:12.689
in our books.json file.

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:30.950
So we’ll need an id, name, productCode,
releaseDate, description, author, genre, specifications,

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:41.819
inStock, price, starRating, and imageUrl
Now if I wanted to use this interface in my

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:50.359
bookslist component file, then I would just
need to import it like this.

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:56.990
Then I can comment out this IBook interface
that we already declared below.

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:02.659
And if we check our implementation down below
notice we are getting a squiggly line error.

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:09.330
To fix this we would need to change the key
names to match what we defined in our interface

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:10.350
above.

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:15.819
Since this was just an introduction to interfaces
I’m going to leave it how it is and we’ll

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:19.860
re-visit and fix this when we get to the section
called Services.
