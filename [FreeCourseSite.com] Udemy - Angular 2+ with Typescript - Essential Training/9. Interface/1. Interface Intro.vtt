00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:05.779
In this section we’re going to be talking
about Interfaces in Typescript.

00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:12.230
We’ll start off with a definition of what
interfaces are and explore why they are used.

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:16.880
We’ll then work through a few different
examples and explore the different ways we

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.279
can go about implementing an interface.

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:25.320
And then we’ll create and use a Book interface
in our existing application.
